## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-15

### üéâ Major Release - Production Ready!

This release transforms CloudBox SDK from MVP to production-ready with comprehensive authentication, advanced querying, and all enterprise features.

### ‚úÖ Added

#### Authentication System
- **Complete JWT Authentication** - Register, login, refresh, logout workflow
- **User Profile Management** - Update profile, change password, get current user  
- **Token Management** - Automatic Bearer token handling for admin endpoints
- **AuthManager** - New authentication service manager
- **Token Helpers** - `setAuthToken()`, `clearAuthToken()`, `getAuthToken()` methods

#### Advanced Querying  
- **Query API** - Advanced filtering with multiple operators (`eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in`, `nin`, `contains`)
- **MongoDB-style Find** - `find()` method for easy migration from MongoDB
- **Proper Pagination** - `ListDocumentsResponse` with `documents`, `total`, `limit`, `offset`
- **Document Count** - `count()` method with optional filtering
- **Sorting** - Multi-field sorting with ascending/descending order

#### Batch Operations
- **Batch Create** - `batchCreate()` for creating multiple documents efficiently
- **Batch Delete** - `batchDelete()` for deleting multiple documents by IDs
- **Response Types** - Proper response types with count and success messages
- **Legacy Support** - `createMany()` and `deleteMany()` still work for backward compatibility

#### Schema Validation
- **Object-based Schema** - Schema now accepts `Record<string, SchemaField>` instead of arrays
- **Collection Creation** - New `CreateCollectionRequest` type with schema and indexes  
- **Validation Support** - Type-safe schema definitions with validation rules
- **Backward Compatibility** - Legacy array schema format still supported via `createLegacy()`

### üîß Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **Config Object** - `projectSlug` ‚Üí `projectId` for consistency
- **Collection Creation** - Now accepts object with name, schema, description, indexes
- **List Documents Response** - Returns object with `{ documents, total, limit, offset }` instead of array
- **Query Method** - Uses POST method with structured request body
